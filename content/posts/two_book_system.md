Some books are really hard to read and it is easy to lose motivation.
The `Two Book System` proposes a way of ensuring continued reading no
matter the book. This is especially helpful for assignments or
necessary reading instead of _for fun_ reading.

-   Stretch-Book: The `Stretch-Book` is the difficult one. It is complex
    and often _not fun_ to read. This book should still be interesting and
    there should be a reason to read it, but it usually contains
    passages that are boring or difficult to understand, making long
    reading sessions draining.
-   Keep-Book: If reading the `Stretch-Book` ever gets too much or a pause
    is needed, the `Keep-Book` is used. It should be light and easy,
    whilst also being interesting and useful. While Novels are great for
    this, the `Keep-Book` might be used for shorter sessions, making an
    overly complex story difficult to switch.
