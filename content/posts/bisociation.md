In order to find new ideas it can be a viable strategy to think
outside the realm of what is currently done or what is currently
possible, because only those ideas will truly stand out.

In order to achieve this without building up an entire system from
[First principles]({{< relref "first_principles" >}}), it can be a good strategy to combine two completely
different items into something new. This might mean to apply a
property of one onto another or create a completely item out of the
combination.
