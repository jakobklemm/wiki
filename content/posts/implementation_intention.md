A task is easier to do and quicker to become a habit if they have a
specific trigger. An implementation intention describes the specific
conditions and the situation that needs to exist, in order to trigger
another task.

For habits it is best if the situation occurs regularly and the
conditions apply broadly enough to allow frequent execution. But it is
important, that it is specific enough to be directly actionable.
