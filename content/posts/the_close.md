Humans have evolved to life in tribes. We adapt the behavior of the
people around us and feel easily peer pressured.

In order to learn a new habit or behavior it is easiest to join a
group where the desired behavior is the normal behavior.

> Nothing sustains motivation better than belonging to the tribe. -
