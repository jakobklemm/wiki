Humans are rewarded the easiest using [Dopamine]({{< relref "dopamine" >}}), since it is the humans
natural way of reward. The issue is that the natural reward system can
be used in both directions the same way, meaning good habits use the
same reward system as bad ones.

If dopamine is still not enough to learn a new difficult habit you can
change your [Habit perspective]({{< relref "habit_perspective" >}}) on it.

It can also be easier to do learn a habit, if it is the social norm or
enforced through culture. This is highly effective, since humans are
herd animals.

We imitate the behavior of three groups:

-   [The close]({{< relref "the_close" >}})
-   [The many]({{< relref "the_many" >}})
-   [The powerful]({{< relref "the_powerful" >}})

Another possibility utilizing [The close]({{< relref "the_close" >}}) might be inform somebody about
your new habit. This can then make it difficult to break a habit,
since it would disappoint the other person. If simply informing them
is not enough a [Habit contract]({{< relref "habit_contract" >}}) can be used.

It is also important to understand `Why?` you are doing it (or
anything), so you need to understand your [Motivation]({{< relref "motivation" >}}).
