In order to start / trigger a habit without having to waste brain
power on it is effective to use cues, which are connected to the
individual habits. It is possible to attach new habits to existing
ones using [Habit stacking]({{< relref "habit_stacking" >}}) or to attach them to specific events or
situations using a [Implementation intention]({{< relref "implementation_intention" >}}) Through out all of them it
is much more important to focus on the external [Environment]({{< relref "environment" >}}) instead of
yourself.
