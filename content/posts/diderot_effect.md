The _Diderot effect_ is most commonly used to describe spending habits.
It describes how people often go into a spiral of spending after
buying just a single expensive product. The effect, named after
Denis Diderot (1713-1784), is made up of two components:

-   Identity: If a consumer purchases an expensive good, his identity
    changes. After the first more expensive good he sees himself as
    somebody, that spends more on goods.
-   Chain: Sometimes seeing that single more expensive item can look out
    of place. Some people then feel the need to purchase more and more
    similarly expensive goods, in order to complement the initial one.
