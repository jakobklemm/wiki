Dopamine is often associated with pleasure. But it is also released
when pleasure is anticipated. If your dopamine level rises, so does
your motivation to act.

This can be utilized in two different ways:

-   Using the dopamine of one task can be used to get the next one
    started ([Habit stacking]({{< relref "habit_stacking" >}})).
-   Connecting a positive habit with a negative one ([Temptation
    bundling]({{< relref "temptation_bundling" >}})).

But this can lead to over expectation, like being more excited about
ordering and selecting a new product then when you actually have it
and get to use it.
