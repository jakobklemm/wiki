While a task itself might not provide satisfaction, seeing progress
is. One easy form of immediate gratification might be to visualize and
measure each repetition and show the progress. After a certain number
of repetitions, _breaking the chain_ becomes a reason to keep the habit
going.

Just seeing progress being made often is enough motivation to keep
going. With each step the desire to continue grows. In addition a
habit tracker makes it more difficult to lie to yourself and live in
an illusion or distorted view of the world.

An easy example of a habit tracker might be the visual Github Commit
Overview. The fear of seeing an empty square can be motivation enough
to keep regular commits going.

At first glance habit tracking might seem like an additional habit
that now also needs to be internalized. Preferably the tracking should
be fully automated (like on Github), but if thats not possible it
might be helpful to use [Habit stacking]({{< relref "habit_stacking" >}}) to trigger the tracking of a
habit after the habit itself.
