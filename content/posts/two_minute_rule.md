When learning any new habit the initial task should take less than two
minutes. While this approach doesn't sound practical or helpful, it is
important to understand, that a two-minute habit isn't about mastering
the craft or learning the skill.
It is about learning to learn the skill.
With the two-minute rule you learn the habit of showing up, of trying
to learn something. Once that has been established, the habit can be
improved, in order to learn the actual skill and achieve the goal.

This approach doesn't just work with small habits, since any life goal
can be expressed as a combination or chain of two-minute habits.
