We spend a lot of time trying to fit in, be part of a group. But once
were in, we start trying to stand out. For that we look to people that
already stand out, most commonly the famous and powerful, in order to
imitate their habits. It is quickly obvious that this can't possibly
work, since copying somebody with the goal of standing out is not
feasible.
