# Personal knowledge database
All data in the **database** directory is unstructured and linked by context. Locally the data is indexed using org-roam and them exported to this wiki using [org-wikijs](https://github.com/jakobklemm/org-wikijs). There is no categorization or hirarchy to the data, each entry is equally valuable.

In this part of the wiki only short notes, concepts and ideas will be stored and interconnected. Those ideas will then be used for projects, papers or other use cases. Some of those will be made available in the **structured** part of the wiki.

The same rules and restrictions of the entire wiki apply to this part as well.
