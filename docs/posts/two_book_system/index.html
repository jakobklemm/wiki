Some books are really hard to read and it is easy to lose motivation.
The <code>Two Book System</code> proposes a way of ensuring continued reading no
matter the book. This is especially helpful for assignments or
necessary reading instead of <em>for fun</em> reading.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stretch-Book: The <code>Stretch-Book</code> is the difficult one. It is complex
and often <em>not fun</em> to read. This book should still be interesting and
there should be a reason to read it, but it usually contains
passages that are boring or difficult to understand, making long
reading sessions draining.</li>
<li>Keep-Book: If reading the <code>Stretch-Book</code> ever gets too much or a pause
is needed, the <code>Keep-Book</code> is used. It should be light and easy,
whilst also being interesting and useful. While Novels are great for
this, the <code>Keep-Book</code> might be used for shorter sessions, making an
overly complex story difficult to switch.</li>
</ul>
