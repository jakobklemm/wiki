        <p>While our lives are shaped a lot by external forces and events or
people that are outside our control, some people believe that we can
still manifest our own destiny and take control over our own lives.
The degree to which people believe things are within their control is
called <code>Locus of control</code> and it is often referred to as a key factor of
success.</p>
<p>If you simply believe your live to be miserable because other people
or your environment makes you miserable, you will have no motivation
or reason to change and take initiative. But by realizing that we are
in full control of our lives it is also possible to change your
perspective on the elements that many people consider responsible for
their misery. Instead of viewing them as external forces that are
against your own plans, that are against you, you can view them as
opportunities and new perspectives on the world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With an internal locus of control it will feel less like live is
happening and more like live is happening due to you. Joey Schweitzer
