<ol>
<li>Its not the events that disturb us.
<strong>The world doesn&rsquo;t disturb us.</strong>. Only the mind can do that. Not the events, but
our own experience of them causes how we feel.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
To think one shouldn&rsquo;t suffer or experience a loss shows that one is in
denial of nature. Nature is outside of our control. The flow of events (Tao)
is outside our control</li>
<li>Most things have happened before.
We only have a limited view of live. We only think about what we have
experienced and seen. But the universe comes in cycles or waves. If we
haven&rsquo;t experienced a wave before, everything appears to be unprecedented.
But almost everything has happened before. (Meditations 7-49: Rhythm of events)</li>
<li>Our thoughts are unreliable.
Overthinking decisions and possible outcomes causes stress and anxiety but
achieves nothing. The future is outside our control.\\ (Excessive thinking)
<strong>We suffer more in often in imagination then in reality.</strong> - Seneca.</li>
<li>Adversity can make us stronger.
Going through misery and hardship isn&rsquo;t terrible or bad. It is outside our
control and part of the flow. But being able to thrive after all we have
been through is great. Don&rsquo;t focus on how bad things are but how we can get
through them.</li>
<li>The present is all we have.
Animals live in the moment.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Humans live in the past &amp; future. We worry about things outside our control.
The future and the past aren&rsquo;t real, they only exist in our thoughts. If we
don&rsquo;t think about them, don&rsquo;t worry about them, they don&rsquo;t exist.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
This doesn&rsquo;t mean you shouldn&rsquo;t have memories or plans. But the past and the
future cannot touch us, we only exist in the present.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;re dying anyway.
At death the majority of death has already happened. Its a process over years
of our lives and it is inevitable. Spend your time well because you could die
any moment. -&gt; Live in the present.</li>
<li>In the grand scheme of things, we&rsquo;re not important.
Put life and all humans into perspective. Relative to the world and the
universe we are insignificant. Most of our decisions and thoughts make no
difference in the grand scheme of things.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
But you can try to make a difference, leave your mark on the world and be
remembered.</li>
