        <p>If someone has authority over you it is usual to follow their orders,
even when there is no direct advantage or only a delayed one.</p>
<p>But habits are inherently different. They are agreements with
yourself, so you do something that you hope will have an advantage for
you in the future. Sadly <em>&ldquo;you&rdquo;</em> don&rsquo;t really have any authority over
yourself. Most people wouldn&rsquo;t say they treat themselves as an
well as they treat others.</p>
<p>In order to stick with difficult habits it might be helpful to use a
<code>Habit contract</code>. Once the decision has been made to adopt a new habit,
it is easy to create a contract with somebody else. That person is
then the authority over you for that specific habit.
(There are even sites and tools that make this process simple and
allow money to be invested, increasing the stakes.)</p>
<p>If a proper contract is too much work it might be enough to simply
tell somebody about your new habit or your goals. The thought of
disappointing them could be enough to motivate somebody.</p>
