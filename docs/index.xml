      <description>(Not physical forces, but friction in human behavior.) Humans only do what is easy and convenient for them. They try to avoid more friction at any cost.
In order to achieve anything it is important to reduce the fiction of it as much as possible.
 An action has less friction if it fits in our current flow, our current routine or structure. Addition by subtraction Remove anything that is not directly helpful for the end goal.</description>

      <description>Most of what we do on a day to day basis isn&amp;rsquo;t something we want to do. We do it because we hope that it can help us to achieve what we really want. Most habits and actions are in a sens just obstacles. We only really want what the habit or action produces or delivers.
In order to learn new habits and keep repeating existing ones a few things are important: Habits are triggered by cues, so it is important to Make it obvious.</description>

      <title>Dopamine</title>

      <description>Dopamine is often associated with pleasure. But it is also released when pleasure is anticipated. If your dopamine level rises, so does your motivation to act.
This can be utilized in two different ways:
 Using the dopamine of one task can be used to get the next one started (Habit stacking). Connecting a positive habit with a negative one (Temptation bundling).  But this can lead to over expectation, like being more excited about ordering and selecting a new product then when you actually have it and get to use it.</description>

      <description>The goal of social media sites is not to connect people or to enhance their lives, the goal is to reduce their users freedom of choice in order to increase their profits. Through data these companies can make choices for you, present them with their choice and still give you the feeling of being in control.
This can quickly lead to a feedback loop, where companies and platforms work together and feed their products directly to customers without using the free market and ignoring the principles of Capitalism.</description>

      <title>Habit tracker</title>

      <description>While a task itself might not provide satisfaction, seeing progress is. One easy form of immediate gratification might be to visualize and measure each repetition and show the progress. After a certain number of repetitions, breaking the chain becomes a reason to keep the habit going.
Just seeing progress being made often is enough motivation to keep going. With each step the desire to continue grows. In addition a habit tracker makes it more difficult to lie to yourself and live in an illusion or distorted view of the world.</description>

      <description>In order to get things you have to do done it is possible to connect them to a habit you want to do.
It can be even better to connect temptation bundling with Habit stacking, to create a new system with three components: A current habit -&amp;gt; Something you have to do -&amp;gt; Something you want to do.
If these two actions are done together often enough it becomes natural to do the obligation before the joy.</description>

      <description>Instead of trying to attach a habit to a situation, place or time, it can be easier to attach it to an existing habit. This has a few advantages:
 You are already in an habit-mindset, making the transition easier. The decision of what to do next is heavily influenced by what we just did / completed. (The Diderot effect) describes a similar behavior, but in the context of spending habits and spirals.</description>

      <description>If a habit breaks down and a repetition is missed it is important to follow the Two-Day Rule, which states that you can never miss two repetitions in a row.
Missing more than one repetition in a row is dangerous, because the habit of not doing the habit can build quickly. As soon as one streak ends, one chain is broken, the next one is started immediately.</description>

      <description>Die AIM-9 Sidewinder war die erste wärmesuchende Luft zu Luft Rakete der Welt. Sie wurde unter extremer Geheimhaltung entwickelt und war der Soviet Union Jahre voraus.
Während der chinesischen Offensive gegen Taiwan unterstützen beide Seiten den Konflikt. Mit den MiG-17 Flugzeugen hatte China den klaren Vorteil, da Taiwan nicht im Besitz von Waffen oder Flugzeugen mit einer ähnlichen Maximalhöhe war. Im geheimen bekam Taiwan einige Sidewinder-Raketen und das nötige Training. In den Luftkämpfen wurden zum ersten mal gelenkte Luft-Luft-Raketen eingesetzt.</description>

      <description>In a sequence of options where you can only ever decide on the current one it is important to know when to stop.
While there are exceptions the important number is 37%.
If the task is to purchase a house, then the first 37% of them should be reviewed but not actually considered. After that threshold has been passed, the next best house has to be bought. The rules for that aren&amp;rsquo;t as exact, but if the item can be measured using comparable numbers it should be better than any previous.</description>

      <description>In order to start / trigger a habit without having to waste brain power on it is effective to use cues, which are connected to the individual habits. It is possible to attach new habits to existing ones using Habit stacking or to attach them to specific events or situations using a Implementation intention Through out all of them it is much more important to focus on the external Environment instead of yourself.</description>

      <description>Most of the time we are so focused on how to do something in the optimal way, that we don&amp;rsquo;t actually do it. James Clear describes it as Motion or Action. You feel like you are getting something done, but your actually only planning to get something done.
But why aren&amp;rsquo;t all habits easy? Humans always choose the path of least resistance. They always try to minimize Friction.
A lot of the decisions we make every day are just habits.</description>

      <description>While good habits are important for success, in most situations not having bad habits can be enough.
Instead of using willpower to fight against temptation it might be helpful to use a Commitment device, in order to automate the decision and remove any human error from it.</description>

      <description>Humans are rewarded the easiest using Dopamine, since it is the humans natural way of reward. The issue is that the natural reward system can be used in both directions the same way, meaning good habits use the same reward system as bad ones.
If dopamine is still not enough to learn a new difficult habit you can change your Habit perspective on it.
It can also be easier to do learn a habit, if it is the social norm or enforced through culture.</description>

      <description>While our lives are shaped a lot by external forces and events or people that are outside our control, some people believe that we can still manifest our own destiny and take control over our own lives. The degree to which people believe things are within their control is called Locus of control and it is often referred to as a key factor of success.
If you simply believe your live to be miserable because other people or your environment makes you miserable, you will have no motivation or reason to change and take initiative.</description>

      <description>If someone has authority over you it is usual to follow their orders, even when there is no direct advantage or only a delayed one.
But habits are inherently different. They are agreements with yourself, so you do something that you hope will have an advantage for you in the future. Sadly &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rdquo; don&amp;rsquo;t really have any authority over yourself. Most people wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say they treat themselves as an well as they treat others.</description>

      <description>(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaTcicNDpQc&amp;amp;ab%5Fchannel=R.C.Waldun) Some books are really hard to read and it is easy to lose motivation. The Two Book System proposes a way of ensuring continued reading no matter the book. This is especially helpful for assignments or necessary reading instead of for fun reading.
 Stretch-Book: The Stretch-Book is the difficult one. It is complex and often not fun to read. This book should still be interesting and there should be a reason to read it, but it usually contains passages that are boring or difficult to understand, making long reading sessions draining.</description>

      <description>Even if the people around us aren&amp;rsquo;t close to us we can easily feel peer pressured by them or follow their behavior. We constantly look to at our Environment on how to act. Even when we know that the group is wrong we would rather be wrong with the crowd rather than right alone.</description>

      <description>Mit dem Klimawandel haben wir das zentrale Problem unserer Zeit vor uns. Während viele neue Gesetze, neue Regulationen und aufgezwungene soziale Änderungen verlangen, gibt es eine Alternative.
Der Grund wieso wir in dieser Situation gelandet sind ist Fortschritt und wissenschaftliche Entwicklungen. Durch die industrielle Revolution und unsere Abhängigkeit von Öl sind wurden unglaubliche Mengen an Geld generiert und Vermögen gemacht. Wenn es nun an der Zeit ist das nächste Zeitalter zu starten gibt es neue, viel grössere Summen zu machen.</description>

      <description>The most productive state a person can be in is called Flow state. In it people often lose their sense of time and fully focus on one task. In order to achieve flow state the task at hand needs to have the right level of difficulty:
 With easy tasks people become bored easily. Difficult tasks create frustration.  In order to get into and stay in flow state a task should have a difficulty of 4% beyond the current level.</description>

      <description>It has always be important to have accurate data about people. But historic methods were not evaluating natural behavior. Instead they were using tools with a high possibility of Cognitive bias.
With modern technology it is possible to capture the natural behavior of users. Online users don&amp;rsquo;t feel spied on and feel save. Therefore the recorded behavior is more accurate and natural.</description>

      <description>Die Ideen von Walerij Gerassimov (Chef des russischen Genealstabs) beschreiben eine neue Art der Kriegsführung:
 Lage vor einem militärischen Konflikt kann man bereits anfangen die Bevölkerung zu beeinflussen und Unterstützung zu gewinnen. Neue Technologien erlauben zielgerichtete Propaganda (Cambridge Analytica). Die Strategien sind stark asymmetrisch und erfordern gute Daten sowie eine gute Verteilinfrastruktur (Socia media).   Die Regeln des Krieges haben sich verändert. Die Rolle der nicht-militärischen Mittel, um politische und strategische Ziele zu erreichen, ist grösser geworden.</description>

Through the missing knowledge about the inner workings users are easily exploited, ether as customers for financial gains or in order to increase foreign influence through Digital Colonialism.</description>

      <description>The motion of modern social media sites is a continuous scrolling without ever ending. This motion can be compared to slot machines, where the user would constantly pull down on a lever. But the two aren&amp;rsquo;t just similar in motion, they also serve the same purpose: They provide a simple, repetitive motion, to which users will get addicted.</description>

      <description>We are being raised to trust the institutions, to believe the people in power have our interests in mind and that their will always be a plan.
But in reality those institutions are made up of people, all with their own agendas and interests. So the only way to have long term prosperity for each individual is to let each individual be in charge of their own decisions and to keep government out of it as much as possible, while enforcing justice and morality not through laws but through principles (Kategorischer Imperativ (Immanuel Kant)).</description>

      <description>It could be argued that while an objective reality does exist it can never be used / discussed by humans, since they will always apply their own filter, their own bias.
But since no human knows objective reality the perspective with which someone looks at the world becomes important. Just by changing someones perspective (for example by asking a different question) they will have a new interpretation of reality.</description>

      <description>The fundamental idea of capitalism consists of sovereign individuals owning capital.
This simple idea can be used to create incredible products, advance mankind and fulfill the lives of those individuals. The opposite is also true: Those who don&amp;rsquo;t constantly improve and innovate will fail and won&amp;rsquo;t survive. This is why capitalism has been responsible for most of our recent progress and has brought our standard of living to new heights.</description>

      <description>At the deepest, underlying level we only want to satisfy a few fundamental needs:
 Conserve energy Obtain food and water Find love and reproduce Connect and bond with others Win social acceptance and approval Reduce uncertainty Achieve status and prestige  Almost anything we do is to fulfill one of those needs. As a base state we also don&amp;rsquo;t ever act, unless we predict that in the short term we would be better of and could more easily meet one of our underlying desires.</description>

      <title>Two-Minute Rule</title>

      <description>When learning any new habit the initial task should take less than two minutes. While this approach doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound practical or helpful, it is important to understand, that a two-minute habit isn&amp;rsquo;t about mastering the craft or learning the skill. It is about learning to learn the skill. With the two-minute rule you learn the habit of showing up, of trying to learn something. Once that has been established, the habit can be improved, in order to learn the actual skill and achieve the goal.</description>

      <description>We spend a lot of time trying to fit in, be part of a group. But once were in, we start trying to stand out. For that we look to people that already stand out, most commonly the famous and powerful, in order to imitate their habits. It is quickly obvious that this can&amp;rsquo;t possibly work, since copying somebody with the goal of standing out is not feasible.</description>

      <description>Humans have evolved to life in tribes. We adapt the behavior of the people around us and feel easily peer pressured.
In order to learn a new habit or behavior it is easiest to join a group where the desired behavior is the normal behavior.
 Nothing sustains motivation better than belonging to the tribe. - James Clear (Atomic Habits, P.118)

      <description>The people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to use it the least. - James Clear (Atomic Habits, P.93)
 Instead of building willpower and self control in order to resist urges and feelings, it is easier to redesign the Environment, in order to have less triggers.
Physically removing food or other consumable goods is an easy first step. It is important to understand, that simply trying to build up the mental resilience to fight these urges is mostly pointless and highly inefficient.</description>

      <description>Success is in most cases not determined by what skills you have our how much risk you take, but by how much you are willing to sacrifice now, to achieve something then.
Almost everything we consider significant in today&amp;rsquo;s world has a delayed gratification. For most of history humans lived in an environment of instant gratification, meaning good actions would be rewarded immediately (food and survival) and bad tasks would be punished immediately (death).</description>

      <description>7 Stoic principles for inner peace. (Einzelgänger - YouTube) Its not the events that disturb us. The world doesn&amp;rsquo;t disturb us.. Only the mind can do that. Not the events, but our own experience of them causes how we feel.To think one shouldn&amp;rsquo;t suffer or experience a loss shows that one is in denial of nature. Nature is outside of our control. The flow of events (Tao) is outside our control Most things have happened before.</description>

      <description>Cardinal Rule of Behavior: What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided.
The habits that stick and the tasks that we repeat are determined by what we are rewarded for now. Sadly most habits that we would consider useful don&amp;rsquo;t have instant rewards. Instead they need to be repeated in order for the effects to show. Even worse: a lot of bad habits have instant gratification, while a lot of good habits don&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>Viele versuchen aus politischen, religiösen oder finanziellen Gründen Kultur zu verändern. Aber was ist Kultur überhaupt? Ohne eine klare Antwort auf diese Frage ist es unmöglich, Kultur zielgerichtet zu verändern, da es für Veränderung die Möglichkeit geben muss, etwas zu messen. Nur so lassen sich vergleiche Anstellen und tatsächliche Veränderung feststellen. Ohne Definition lässt sich etwas allerdings nicht messen, daher auch nicht verändern.
Im Beschreiben von Kultur werden oft die gleichen Worte und Begriffe verwendet, wie wenn es um Personen geht.</description>

      <description>A task is easier to do and quicker to become a habit if they have a specific trigger. An implementation intention describes the specific conditions and the situation that needs to exist, in order to trigger another task.
For habits it is best if the situation occurs regularly and the conditions apply broadly enough to allow frequent execution. But it is important, that it is specific enough to be directly actionable.</description>

      <description>Since we constantly run predictions, it is possible to change the outcome of these predictions, in order to change our perception of things. If you can change your view on them and turn them into something positive, something you get to do, there is nothing to overcome and you want to do them.</description>

      <description>Early in our lives we learned some basic information and concepts from some higher authority. Without the ability to think about fundamental issues and complex concepts, this was the best idea for acquiring information.
But once we are able to think critically about the world this system becomes problematic. While it is the easiest and requires the least amount energy or critical reflection, it has a few fundamental issues:
 The information usually comes from some higher authority, hows interest may not be aligned with ours.</description>

      <description>In order to reduce the amount of triggers as well as the amount of self control needed to fight against them it is important to design your environment properly.
Once a habit is learned and internalized, it is unlikely to be forgotten. The only way to stop doing it is to remove the cues that trigger it.
This also works the other way around. If you want to learn a new (good) habit, it is possible to bind or connect it to an item in the environment.</description>

      <description>„Wenn man inkompetent ist, kann man nicht wissen, dass man inkompetent ist […] Die Fähigkeiten, die Sie benötigen, um eine richtige Antwort zu geben, sind genau die Fähigkeiten, die Sie benötigen, um zu erkennen, was eine richtige Antwort ist.“– David Dunning
 Menschen können das Ausmass ihrer eigenen Inkompetenz nicht erkennen. Sie fühlen sich kompetent in Gebieten von denen sie keine Ahnung haben.Weniger kompetente Personen neigen dazu
 ihre eigenen Fähigkeiten zu überschätzen, überlegende Fähigkeiten bei anderen nicht zu erkennen, das Ausmass ihrer eigenen Unfähigkeit nicht richtig einschätzen zu können.</description>

      <description>The Diderot effect is most commonly used to describe spending habits. It describes how people often go into a spiral of spending after buying just a single expensive product. The effect, named after Denis Diderot (1713-1784), is made up of two components:
 Identity: If a consumer purchases an expensive good, his identity changes. After the first more expensive good he sees himself as somebody, that spends more on goods. Chain: Sometimes seeing that single more expensive item can look out of place.</description>

      <description>The easiest way to break a bad habit is to make it impractical. This can be achieved by using commitment devices. (The opposite is also true: To achieve a good habit simply make it the preferred behavior.)
The key is to make it difficult to break the current good habit. For this it might be practical to automate the decisions, since humans are likely to fall for temptation.</description>

      <description>In order to find new ideas it can be a viable strategy to think outside the realm of what is currently done or what is currently possible, because only those ideas will truly stand out.
In order to achieve this without building up an entire system from First principles, it can be a good strategy to combine two completely different items into something new. This might mean to apply a property of one onto another or create a completely item out of the combination.</description>

      <description>Our modern economy is mostly capitalistic (Capitalism) with a few twists:
 Some industries have strong government involvement. Very few people support the current system in it&amp;rsquo;s entirety (For some there is not enough government intervention and support, for others there is too much). When talking about the economy people don&amp;rsquo;t feel like they are a part of it (They think the economy is something bankers do).  </description>

      <description>Planning and strategizing about something can be described as being in motion. The steps are important, but they don&amp;rsquo;t produce a result. For that you need to take action.
Example:
 Planning to write a book and mapping out each chapter is motion. Actually writing it is action.  Why is it so hard to take action over motion? While in motion we feel like we are making progress without running the risk of failure.</description>

      <description>When underlining and processing into the system is not enough to retain relevant information, margin notes can be used. They get you to think about the content while reading, meaning later context switching is easier or not at all necessary. Therefor margin notes should not be seen as a replacement or alternative to my personal reading system, but rather as an extension and tool to better utilize the current system.</description>

      <description>Moralität wurde historisch immer über Religion und Gott bestimmt. Aber ein solches System ist natürlich voller Probleme und Fehler die schnell offensichtlich werden. Es muss eingesehen werden, dass die allermeisten religiösen Moralsysteme fundamentale Probleme und Fehler haben. Da Menschen Anhänger verschiedener Religionen sind und selbst innerhalb einer Religion verschiedene Menschen verschiedene moralische Grundsätze haben, war es von Nöten eine andere, von Religion losgelöste Moral zu entwickeln.
Immanuel Kant (1724 - 1804) war einer der ersten, der Moral basierend auf Logik und Rationalität präsentierte.</description>
