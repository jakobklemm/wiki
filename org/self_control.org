#+title: Self control

The people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need
to use it the least. - James Clear (Atomic Habits, P.93)

Instead of building willpower and self control in order to resist
urges and feelings, it is easier to redesign the [[file:environment.org][Environment]], in order
to have less triggers.

Physically removing food or other consumable goods is an easy first
step. It is important to understand, that simply trying to build up
the mental resilience to fight these urges is mostly pointless and
highly inefficient. But if there is no self control needed what so
ever there is also no danger of not having enough strength.

Self control is only a short-term strategy, not a long term one, since
it can be considered an /active process/. Properly designing your
environment on the other hand is a long term solution, because after
the environment is changed no more willpower or strength is needed to
resist bad cues.
