#+title: Environment

In order to reduce the amount of triggers as well as the amount of
self control needed to fight against them it is important to design
your environment properly.

Once a habit is learned and internalized, it is unlikely to be
forgotten. The only way to stop doing it is to remove the cues that
trigger it.

This also works the other way around. If you want to learn a new
(good) habit, it is possible to bind or connect it to an item in the
environment. This often happens with people. When the environment is
filled with negative influences it is easy to adopt their behavior.

Removing negative cues and influences from an environment is
important.
