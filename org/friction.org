#+title: Friction
(Not physical forces, but friction in human behavior.)
Humans only do what is easy and convenient for them. They try to
avoid more friction at any cost.

In order to achieve anything it is important to reduce the fiction of
it as much as possible.
- An action has less friction if it fits in our current flow, our
  current routine or structure.
- Addition by subtraction
  Remove anything that is not directly helpful for the end goal. By
  doing this you can remove as much friction as possible and focus on
  what really matters. This is done by adjusting the environment and
  creating one, where doing the right thing is as easy as possible.
- Prime the environment for immediate use. Already place the items
  needed for the next task in a visible location. This also works as a
  cue.
