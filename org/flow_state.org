#+title: Flow state

The most productive state a person can be in is called Flow state. In
it people often lose their sense of time and fully focus on one task.
In order to achieve flow state the task at hand needs to have the
right level of difficulty:
- With easy tasks people become bored easily.
- Difficult tasks create frustration.
In order to get into and stay in flow state a task should have a
difficulty of /4%/ beyond the current level. When a task is slightly
outside the current ability, the brain needs to actually think and
improve in order to achieve it.
