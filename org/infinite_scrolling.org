#+title: Infinite scrolling

The motion of modern social media sites is a continuous scrolling
without ever ending. This motion can be compared to slot machines,
where the user would constantly pull down on a lever. But the two
aren't just similar in motion, they also serve the same purpose: They
provide a simple, repetitive motion, to which users will get addicted.
