#+title: Temptation bundling

In order to get things you have to do done it is possible to connect
them to a habit you want to do.

It can be even better to connect temptation bundling with [[file:habit_stacking.org][Habit
stacking]], to create a new system with three components: A current
habit -> Something you have to do -> Something you want to do.

If these two actions are done together often enough it becomes natural
to do the obligation before the joy.
