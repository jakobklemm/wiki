#+title: Sacrifice

Success is in most cases not determined by what skills you have our
how much risk you take, but by how much you are willing to sacrifice
*now*, to achieve something *then*.

Almost everything we consider significant in today's world has a
delayed gratification. For most of history humans lived in an
environment of instant gratification, meaning good actions would be
rewarded immediately (food and survival) and bad tasks would be
punished immediately (death). But in our modern society success is a
long term strategy, not a spontaneous event.

For success you need the sacrifice immediate rewards no, in order to
get delayed rewards in the future. But most people spend their days
chasing instant gratification and are not able to wait for their long
term strategies to pay off.
