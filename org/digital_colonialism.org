#+title: Digital Colonialism

After the historic colonialism was abolished new ways were found for
western countries to control and influence the rest of the world.
While most resources flow from the third to the developed world, a few
technologically advanced products come back. Through those western
countries and individuals can heavily influence and profit of the
developing world. Modern technologies also allow these powers to
remain hidden, leaving the people in an illusion.
