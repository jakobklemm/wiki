#+title: Cognitive bias

It could be argued that while an objective reality does exist it can
never be used / discussed by humans, since they will always apply
their own filter, their own bias.

But since no human knows objective reality the perspective with which
someone looks at the world becomes important. Just by changing
someones perspective (for example by asking a different question) they
will have a new interpretation of reality.
