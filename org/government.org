#+title: Government

We are being raised to trust the institutions, to believe the people
in power have our interests in mind and that their will always be a
plan.

But in reality those institutions are made up of people, all with
their own agendas and interests. So the only way to have long term
prosperity for each individual is to let each individual be in charge
of their own decisions and to keep government out of it as much as
possible, while enforcing justice and morality not through laws but
through principles (Kategorischer Imperativ ([[file:immanuel_kant.org][Immanuel Kant]])).
