#+title: Two-Day Rule

If a habit breaks down and a repetition is missed it is important to
follow the =Two-Day Rule=, which states that you can never miss two
repetitions in a row.

Missing more than one repetition in a row is dangerous, because the
*habit of not doing the habit* can build quickly. As soon as one streak
ends, one chain is broken, the next one is started immediately.
