#+title: Capitalism
The fundamental idea of capitalism consists of sovereign individuals owning
capital.

This simple idea can be used to create incredible products, advance
mankind and fulfill the lives of those individuals. The opposite is
also true: Those who don't constantly improve and innovate will fail
and won't survive. This is why capitalism has been responsible for
most of our recent progress and has brought our standard of living to
new heights.

But capitalism is often criticized. In our current society greed and
exploitation is a common occurrence. But one could argue, that greed
itself is not a bad idea. But once people forget long term advantages
and opportunities and simply focus on themselves, have greed for
themselves in the current moment, bad things happen.
Not everybody has an end goal for live or a long term plan for their
future. But if they had they would realize that all non-sustainable,
exploitative behavior is not in their long term interest.
