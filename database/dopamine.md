title: Dopamine

Dopamine is often associated with pleasure. But it is also released when
pleasure is anticipated. If your dopamine level rises, so does your
motivation to act.

This can be utilized in two different ways:

-   Using the dopamine of one task can be used to get the next one
    started ([Habit stacking](/database/habit_stacking)).
-   Connecting a positive habit with a negative one ([Temptation
    bundling](/database/temptation_bundling)).

But this can lead to over expectation, like being more excited about
ordering and selecting a new product then when you actually have it and
get to use it.
