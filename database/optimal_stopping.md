title: Optimal stopping
---

In a sequence of options where you can only ever decide on the current
one it is important to know when to stop.

While there are exceptions the important number is `37%`{.verbatim}.

If the task is to purchase a house, then the first `37%`{.verbatim} of
them should be reviewed but not actually considered. After that
threshold has been passed, the next best house has to be bought. The
rules for that aren\'t as exact, but if the item can be measured using
comparable numbers it should be better than any previous.

(Statistically that is not always possible, since the best one might
have been in the first `37%`{.verbatim}, but overall it should work
out.)
