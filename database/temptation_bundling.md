title: Temptation bundling
---

In order to get things you have to do done it is possible to connect
them to a habit you want to do.

It can be even better to connect temptation bundling with [Habit
stacking](/database/habit_stacking), to create a new
system with three components: A current habit -\> Something you have to
do -\> Something you want to do.

If these two actions are done together often enough it becomes natural
to do the obligation before the joy.
