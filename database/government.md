We are being raised to trust the institutions, to believe the people in
power have our interests in mind and that their will always be a plan.

But in reality those institutions are made up of people, all with their
own agendas and interests. So the only way to have long term prosperity
for each individual is to let each individual be in charge of their own
decisions and to keep government out of it as much as possible, while
enforcing justice and morality not through laws but through principles
(Kategorischer Imperativ ([Immanuel Kant](/database/immanuel_kant))).
