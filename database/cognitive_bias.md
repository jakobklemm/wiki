title: Cognitive bias
---

It could be argued that while an objective reality does exist it can
never be used / discussed by humans, since they will always apply their
own filter, their own bias.

But since no human knows objective reality the perspective with which
someone looks at the world becomes important. Just by changing someones
perspective (for example by asking a different question) they will have
a new interpretation of reality.
