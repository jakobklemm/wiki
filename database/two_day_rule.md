title: Two-Day Rule
---

If a habit breaks down and a repetition is missed it is important to
follow the `Two-Day Rule`, which states that you can never miss two
repetitions in a row.

Missing more than one repetition in a row is dangerous, because the
**habit of not doing the habit** can build quickly. As soon as one
streak ends, one chain is broken, the next one is started immediately.
