In order to find new ideas it can be a viable strategy to think outside
the realm of what is currently done or what is currently possible,
because only those ideas will truly stand out.

In order to achieve this without building up an entire system from

combine two completely different items into something new. This might
mean to apply a property of one onto another or create a completely item
out of the combination.
