title: Infinite scrolling

The motion of modern social media sites is a continuous scrolling
without ever ending. This motion can be compared to slot machines, where
the user would constantly pull down on a lever. But the two aren\'t just
similar in motion, they also serve the same purpose: They provide a
simple, repetitive motion, to which users will get addicted.
