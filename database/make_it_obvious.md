In order to start / trigger a habit without having to waste brain power
on it is effective to use cues, which are connected to the individual
habits. It is possible to attach new habits to existing ones using
[Habit stacking](/database/habit_stacking) or to attach
them to specific events or situations using a [Implementation
intention](/database/implementation_intention) Through out all of them it is
much more important to focus on the external
[Environment](/database/environment) instead of
yourself.
