Some books are really hard to read and it is easy to lose motivation.
The `Two Book System`{.verbatim} proposes a way of ensuring continued
reading no matter the book. This is especially helpful for assignments
or necessary reading instead of *for fun* reading.

-   Stretch-Book: The `Stretch-Book`{.verbatim} is the difficult one. It
    is complex and often *not fun* to read. This book should still be
    interesting and there should be a reason to read it, but it usually
    contains passages that are boring or difficult to understand, making
    long reading sessions draining.
-   Keep-Book: If reading the `Stretch-Book`{.verbatim} ever gets too
    much or a pause is needed, the `Keep-Book`{.verbatim} is used. It
    should be light and easy, whilst also being interesting and useful.
    While Novels are great for this, the `Keep-Book`{.verbatim} might be
    used for shorter sessions, making an overly complex story difficult
    to switch.
