title: Margin notes
---

When underlining and processing into the system is not enough to retain
relevant information, margin notes can be used. They get you to think
about the content while reading, meaning later context switching is
easier or not at all necessary. Therefor margin notes should not be seen
as a replacement or alternative to my personal reading system, but
rather as an extension and tool to better utilize the current system.

What to write:

-   What ever thoughts or emotions the current line triggers.
-   Central ideas that the current point is related to (connections)
-   Summaries or keywords in order to make finding something in the book
    at a later point easier (This functionality would also be fulfilled
    by this indexing system, but some notes might not have been
    transferred or aren\'t currently suitable).
