At the deepest, underlying level we only want to satisfy a few
fundamental needs:

-   Conserve energy
-   Obtain food and water
-   Find love and reproduce
-   Connect and bond with others
-   Win social acceptance and approval
-   Reduce uncertainty
-   Achieve status and prestige

Almost anything we do is to fulfill one of those needs. As a base state
we also don\'t ever act, unless we predict that in the short term we
would be better of and could more easily meet one of our underlying
desires. Most of what we do has no long term view and is only concerned
about the current moment. This was great for survival and reproduction,
but not for our current long term oriented system.
