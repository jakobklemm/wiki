title: Sacrifice
---

Success is in most cases not determined by what skills you have our how
much risk you take, but by how much you are willing to sacrifice
**now**, to achieve something **then**.

Almost everything we consider significant in today\'s world has a
delayed gratification. For most of history humans lived in an
environment of instant gratification, meaning good actions would be
rewarded immediately (food and survival) and bad tasks would be punished
immediately (death). But in our modern society success is a long term
strategy, not a spontaneous event.

For success you need the sacrifice immediate rewards no, in order to get
delayed rewards in the future. But most people spend their days chasing
instant gratification and are not able to wait for their long term
strategies to pay off.
