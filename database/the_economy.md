title: The economy

Our modern economy is mostly capitalistic ([Capitalism](/database/capitalism))
with a few twists:

-   Some industries have strong government involvement.
-   Very few people support the current system in it\'s entirety (For
    some there is not enough government intervention and support, for
    others there is too much).
-   When talking about the economy people don\'t feel like they are a
    part of it (They think the economy is something bankers do).
