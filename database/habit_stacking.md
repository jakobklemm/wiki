title: Habit stacking
---

Instead of trying to attach a habit to a situation, place or time, it
can be easier to attach it to an existing habit. This has a few
advantages:

-   You are already in an *habit-mindset*, making the transition easier.
-   The decision of what to do next is heavily influenced by what we
    just did / completed. (The [Diderot
    effect](id:5bafe3f9-5134-4c0b-b83e-19fa34cd4469) describes a similar
    behavior, but in the context of spending habits and spirals.)
-   After successfully completing a task you can profit of the natural
    momentum that comes from that and directly use it for the next task.
