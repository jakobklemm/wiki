title: Friction
---

(Not physical forces, but friction in human behavior.) Humans only do
what is easy and convenient for them. They try to avoid more friction at
any cost.

In order to achieve anything it is important to reduce the fiction of it
as much as possible.

-   An action has less friction if it fits in our current flow, our
    current routine or structure.
-   Addition by subtraction Remove anything that is not directly helpful
    for the end goal. By doing this you can remove as much friction as
    possible and focus on what really matters. This is done by adjusting
    the environment and creating one, where doing the right thing is as
    easy as possible.
-   Prime the environment for immediate use. Already place the items
    needed for the next task in a visible location. This also works as a
    cue.
