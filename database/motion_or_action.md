title: Motion or Action
---

Planning and strategizing about something can be described as being in
motion. The steps are important, but they don\'t produce a result. For
that you need to take action.

Example:

-   Planning to write a book and mapping out each chapter is motion.
-   Actually writing it is action.

Why is it so hard to take action over motion? While in motion we feel
like we are making progress without running the risk of failure. If you
are planning to do something you can\'t fail. But if you act based on
your plans you can fail. That\'s why only being in motion is so
attractive.
