7 Stoic principles for inner peace. (EinzelgÃ¤nger - YouTube)\
1. Its not the events that disturb us. **The world doesn\'t disturb
us.**. Only the mind can do that. Not the events, but our own experience
of them causes how we feel.\
To think one shouldn\'t suffer or experience a loss shows that one is in
denial of nature. Nature is outside of our control. The flow of events
(Tao) is outside our control

1.  Most things have happened before. We only have a limited view of
    live. We only think about what we have experienced and seen. But the
    universe comes in cycles or waves. If we haven\'t experienced a wave
    before, everything appears to be unprecedented. But almost
    everything has happened before. (Meditations 7-49: Rhythm of events)
2.  Our thoughts are unreliable. Overthinking decisions and possible
    outcomes causes stress and anxiety but achieves nothing. The future
    is outside our control.\\\\ (Excessive thinking) **We suffer more in
    often in imagination then in reality.** - Seneca.
3.  Adversity can make us stronger. Going through misery and hardship
    isn\'t terrible or bad. It is outside our control and part of the
    flow. But being able to thrive after all we have been through is
    great. Don\'t focus on how bad things are but how we can get through
    them.
4.  The present is all we have. Animals live in the moment.\
    Humans live in the past & future. We worry about things outside our
    control. The future and the past aren\'t real, they only exist in
    our thoughts. If we don\'t think about them, don\'t worry about
    them, they don\'t exist.\
    This doesn\'t mean you shouldn\'t have memories or plans. But the
    past and the future cannot touch us, we only exist in the present.
5.  We\'re dying anyway. At death the majority of death has already
    happened. Its a process over years of our lives and it is
    inevitable. Spend your time well because you could die any moment.
    -\> Live in the present.
6.  In the grand scheme of things, we\'re not important. Put life and
    all humans into perspective. Relative to the world and the universe
    we are insignificant. Most of our decisions and thoughts make no
    difference in the grand scheme of things.\
    But you can try to make a difference, leave your mark on the world
    and be remembered.
