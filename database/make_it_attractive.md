Humans are rewarded the easiest using [Dopamine](/database/dopamine), since it
is the humans natural way of reward. The issue is that the natural
reward system can be used in both directions the same way, meaning good
habits use the same reward system as bad ones.

If dopamine is still not enough to learn a new difficult habit you can
change your [Habit perspective](/database/habit_perspective) on it.

It can also be easier to do learn a habit, if it is the social norm or
enforced through culture. This is highly effective, since humans are
herd animals.

We imitate the behavior of three groups:

-   [The close](/database/the_close)
-   [The many](/database/the_many)
-   [The powerful](/database/the_powerful)

Another possibility utilizing [The close](/database/the_close) might be inform
somebody about your new habit. This can then make it difficult to break
a habit, since it would disappoint the other person. If simply informing
them is not enough a [Habit contract](/database/habit_contract) can be used.

It is also important to understand `Why?`{.verbatim} you are doing it
(or anything), so you need to understand your
[Motivation](/database/motivation).
