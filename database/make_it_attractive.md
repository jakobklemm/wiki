Humans are rewarded the easiest using [Dopamine](/database/dopamine), since it
is the humans natural way of reward. The issue is that the natural
reward system can be used in both directions the same way, meaning good
habits use the same reward system as bad ones.

If dopamine is still not enough to learn a new difficult habit you can
change your [Habit perspective](/database/habit_perspective) on it.

It can also be easier to do learn a habit, if it is the social norm or
enforced through culture. This is highly effective, since humans are
herd animals.

We imitate the behavior of three groups:

-   [The close](/database/the_close)
-   [The many](/database/the_many)
-   [The powerful](/database/the_powerful)

But why do we even want to do anything? [Motivation](/database/motivation)
