title: First principles
---

Early in our lives we learned some basic information and concepts from
some higher authority. Without the ability to think about fundamental
issues and complex concepts, this was the best idea for acquiring
information.

But once we are able to think critically about the world this system
becomes problematic. While it is the easiest and requires the least
amount energy or critical reflection, it has a few fundamental issues:

-   The information usually comes from some higher authority, hows
    interest may not be aligned with ours.
-   When something is new or there is no explanation by somebody else we
    reason by analogy. This means we combine something we already know
    or modify it in order to explain something new.

A better strategy for understanding something new (and to understand the
world) is to break it down into its most basic components, its first
principles. If you dig deeper and deeper into a concept until you are
left with nothing but the most fundamental truths of the situation, you
have found the first principles.

First principles have a few key advantages over other thought-systems:

-   Understanding the first principles of a situation will automatically
    result in an understanding of the entire situation.
-   Once the first principles have been found they can be utilized to
    create something new or understand something without having to rely
    on any authority or external source.
-   By only thinking about the most fundamental units of a system a lot
    of unnecessary items or distractions can be removed.

Something similar can be observed in techniques like
[Bisociation](/database/bisociation), where objects aren\'t specifically
broken down into their first principles, but are still reduced and
removed out of their previous context, in order to form something new.
