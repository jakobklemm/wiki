title: Habits

Most of what we do on a day to day basis isn\'t something we want to do.
We do it because we hope that it can help us to achieve what we really
want. Most habits and actions are in a sens just obstacles. We only
really want what the habit or action produces or delivers.

In order to learn new habits and keep repeating existing ones a few
things are important: Habits are triggered by cues, so it is important
to [Make it obvious](/database/make_it_obvious). Once a habit is triggered it
is important to give a reason to do it, to [Make it
attractive](/database/make_it_attractive). Humans always chose the path of
least resistance, meaning just because something is attractive, it might
not be enough to trick ourselves into doing it. That\'s why it is
important to [Make it easy](id:52e11315-5835-4f86-a335-f625ed980136).

Up to now we have looked at tactics to get us started with a habit and
actually do it. But what turns actions into habits is repetition. In
order to stay consistent with our habits, we need to [Make it
satisfying](/database/make_it_satisfying).

In case the system ever breaks down and the chain of repetitions is
broken, it is important to follow the [Two-Day Rule](/database/two_day_rule)
for an easy recovery.
