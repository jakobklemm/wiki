## Jakob Klemm
Should anybody be interested in what is written here? - No.

Is there any reason to use this wiki as a source of information? - No.

This wiki only exists for myself and is not really meant for public consumption. No of the information displayed here is guaranteed to be useful, logical or correct. But feel free to read and use anything written here.

## Wiki
In this wiki you will find anything from short notes and thoughts to full written essays and papers. The topics are about whatever Iâ€™m currently working on and range from computer science to philosophy and religion. 
The wiki is split in two parts:
- Structured
	A lookup table style wiki, mostly used for technical specifications, full written papers and specs for shared projects.
- Database
	A unstructured database with highly interconnected notes, mostly used for ideas and concepts.
