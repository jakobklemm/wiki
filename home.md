## Jakob Klemm
Should anybody be interested in what is written here? - No.

Is there any reason to use this wiki as a source of information? - No.

This wiki only exists for myself and is not really meant for public consumption. No of the information displayed here is guaranteed to be useful, logical or correct. But feel free to read and use anything written here.

## Wiki
In this wiki you will find anything from short notes and thoughts to full written essays and papers. The topics are about whatever Iâ€™m currently working on and range from computer science to philosophy and religion. The entire wiki was written in org-mode with the help of org-roam. This Roam Research implementation allows for the easy interconnection of notes as well as the display of graphs and interactive interfaces to explore the knowledge base.
